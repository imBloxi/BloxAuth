### 2. Set Up Your Environment

To ensure you are working in the right environment, follow the setup instructions in the `README.md` for installing dependencies and configuring the project.

### 3. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. This makes it easier for maintainers to review your work without affecting the main codebase.

- For features:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
- For bug fixes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-description
   ```

### 4. Make Your Changes

Implement your code changes on your branch. Be sure to:

- Keep your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
- Follow the project's coding guidelines and style.
- Keep your changes focusedâ€”small, specific pull requests are easier to review and merge.

### 5. Write Tests

If your changes affect critical functionality or introduce new features, please ensure you write tests to cover your code.

- Run the test suite to ensure everything works before submitting your changes:
   ```bash
   php artisan test
   ```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit your work with clear and descriptive messages.

- Use a concise commit message format:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: New license validation for improved security"
   ```

### 7. Push Your Branch

Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 8. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request:

1. Go to the original [BloxAuth repository](https://github.com/imBloxi/BloxAuth).
2. Navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab and click **New Pull Request**.
3. Select your branch and provide a meaningful description of your changes. Be sure to reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #issue-number").

### 9. Respond to Review Comments

After submitting your pull request, the maintainers will review your changes. You may be asked to make some modifications:

- Address all feedback constructively and respectfully.
- Make the necessary changes and push them to your branch. They will be automatically added to your pull request.

### 10. Code of Conduct

Please make sure to follow the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when contributing to this repository. We are committed to maintaining a welcoming and respectful community for everyone involved.

## Additional Notes

- Keep your pull requests focused. Do not bundle unrelated changes together.
- Make sure your code is tested and does not break any existing functionality.
